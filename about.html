<h1 class="explanationtitle">Two-Way Patch</h1>

<p class="explanation">
  If you are here, you have probably been to Two-Way Patch at CodeBase (Edinburgh). How did <i>The Common Sense</i> by Melanie Gilligan make you feel?
  <br><br>
  <i>The Common Sense</i> presents a near future where invasive digital technology is no longer an option, but spread throughout society. It affects how we communicate, our relationships and our work-life balance. Did this future make you angry? Or are you anxioustly awaiting your own two-way patch?
  <br><br>
  <i>The Common Sense</i> is the first acquisition of the new Research Collection of the University of Edinburgh. Two-Way Patch will be on show at CodeBase from 29 March until 27 April.
  <br><br>
